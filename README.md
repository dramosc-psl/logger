#### Level logging

From: [Logrus README](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus/blob/master/README.md)

Logrus has six logging levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal and Panic.

```go
log.Debug("Useful debugging information.")
log.Info("Something noteworthy happened!")
log.Warn("You should probably take a look at this.")
log.Error("Something failed but I'm not quitting.")

// Calls os.Exit(1) after logging
log.Fatal("Bye.")
// Calls panic() after logging
log.Panic("I'm bailing.")
```

You can set the logging level on a `Logger`, then it will only log entries with
that severity or anything above it:

```go
// Will log anything that is info or above (warn, error, fatal, panic). Default.
log.SetLevel(log.InfoLevel)
```

It may be useful to set `log.Level = logrus.DebugLevel` in a debug or verbose
environment if your application has that.
